{{site.title}} is my homepage and blog. I am a PhD student in Statistics and Epidemiology in the Faculty of Health and Medicine at [Lancaster University](http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/) supervised by [Dr. Benjamin Taylor](http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/staff/taylorb1/) and [Dr. Luke Parry](http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/lec/about-us/people/luke-parry).
